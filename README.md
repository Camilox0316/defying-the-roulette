## Second Project – Challenging a Casino's Roulette

### Introduction

This is a project where We're going to test the roulette wheels of casinos. Does the house always win, or are there techniques that can beat the system?

### What Is This Project About?

There are several strategies and techniques that supposedly 'beat' the casino's roulette. Some of the most common ones are:

- Martingale
- D’Alembert
- Fibonacci Sequence
- Paroli
- Oscar's Grind
- Guetting
- Labouchere
- Inverse Labouchere

While there are many more, these are the main and most commonly used strategies. My idea is to program two of these common techniques to see if they are truly effective or if we end up losing all our money.

### Implementation

To achieve this, I will need to define a system in Bash to control losses and gains using arrays among other tools. I will also define logic to simulate the bets, ensuring everything runs automatically while we observe the statistics and results.

### What I will learn programming this 

- Enhance your Bash scripting skills.
- Learn to use arrays for managing data.
- Develop logic for simulating automated betting systems.
- Analyze the effectiveness of different roulette strategies.
